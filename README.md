# MAD-Project - A Weather App
A simple, web-based weather application built using the ionic framework. The app enables the user to search for current weather data by city or with gps coordinates.


# Motivation
This project is my submission for a Mobile App Development assignment. The assignment constitutes 60% of my grade in this module. I have chosen to develope a weather app 
for this assignment because I believe that a simple idea, executed well can effectively show the techniques and methods better than a more complicated idea executed poorly. Initially, I had planned to build an app using the open NASA APIs. This proved to be beyond my abilities in terms of non-computer science skills. Intead, using the OpenWeatherMap API I have built a tool that is simple and hopefully useful.

# Application Features
My applicaion enables users to: 
  - Search for the current weather data from over 200,000 cities.
  - Get the current weather at their locaion using gps coordinates.
  - See temperature, wind speed, humidity & more for a given search.
  - Configure units of measurement, i.e, Imperial/Metric.
  - Curate a list of locations to track weather for.

# Technologies & Framework 
This application was built using the following technologies:
* [Angular] - TypeScript-based open-source web application framework.
* [Ionic] -  Open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development.
* [Node.js] - Cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment.
* [npm] - Package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
* [Git] - Distributed version-control system.
* [Visual Studio Code] - Code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications

# Installation
After cloning or downloading the zip archive from this Github page:
```sh
$ cd MAD-Project-master
$ ionic serve --lab
? Looks like a fresh checkout! No ./node_modules directory found. Would you like to install project dependencies? (Y/n)
